## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs or Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for IDE. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report :pencil:, reproduce the behavior :computer: :computer:, and find related reports :mag_right:.

 When you are creating a bug report or suggesting an enhancement, please check [how to make good bug report](#how-to-make-a-proper-bug-report?) and [how to make good enhancement Suggestion](#how-to-make-a-proper-enhancement-suggestion?)

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

#### How to make a proper Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).Create an issue in the repository and provide the following information:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs**.
* **If the problem is related to performance or memory**.
* **If Chrome's developer tools pane is shown without you triggering it**.
* **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.


#### How to make a proper Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).Create an issue in the repository and provide the following information:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
* **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** 
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**.
* **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** 
* **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** 
* **List some other text editors or applications where this enhancement exists.**
* **Specify the name and version of the OS you're using.**

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to IDE? You can start by looking through these `beginner`, `good first issues` and `help-wanted` issues.
These issues are brief and mostly consist of docs, low or no code issues.

### Pull Requests

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Provide brief description of what is reproduced.
2. Use proper language while creating PR's.
3. After you submit your pull request, verify that all [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/) are passing <details><summary>What if the status checks are failing?</summary>If a status check is failing, and you believe that the failure is unrelated to your change, please leave a comment on the pull request explaining why you believe the failure is unrelated. A maintainer will re-run the status check for you. If we conclude that the failure was a false positive, then we will open an issue to track that problem with our status check suite.</details>

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.
